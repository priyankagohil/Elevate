I took part in the software edition which was a 36-hour software product development competition and we went till the final round of 
competition. This project was implemented under government of Maharashtra to make life of disabled people and their families easier.
We developed an android application to view Geo-tagged places with photographs, descriptions, and disable friendly facilities 
available at a particular location. This will help people with disabilities to preplan their route and places to go and visit with
facilities for them.
